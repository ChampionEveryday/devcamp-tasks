# devcamp-tasks
A repository containing solutions to the technical tasks for the Devcamp Bootcamp 2020

Tasks
1. Write a function that takes an array of positive integers. The function should calculate the
sum of all even and odd integers and return an array containing the sums. The first index
in the returned array should hold the sum of the even integers and the second index
should hold the sum of the odd integers.

2. Write a function that accepts a positive integer and determines if it is a prime number.
The function should return true, if it is a prime number or false if it isn’t.
3. Write a function that accepts an array of positive integers and returns an array of all
prime numbers from the given array. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by
1 and itself.

4. Create a password validator function that takes in the password as its argument and
returns an integer value you can evaluate to determine the password strength. Using the
following validators:
0 -> very weak e.g. a password with only strings
1 -> weak e.g. a password with only numbers
2 -> strong e.g. a password containing strings and numbers
3 -> very strong e.g. a password containing strings, numbers and special characters
(!,@,#,$,%, etc)

5. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
Example
Input : "Mr John Smith "
Output : "Mr%20John%20Smith"

6. Write a function that takes two parameters, an array and some number. The function
should determine whether any three numbers in the array add up to the number. If it
does, the function should return the numbers as an array. If it doesn’t, the function
should return -1.
Example
Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 6
Output : [1, 2, 3]

7. Write a function that takes an array of positive integers and calculates the standard
deviation of the numbers. The function should return the standard deviation.

8. Write a method to count the number of 3s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and
n (inclusive). It should return an object containing the count of the number of 3s that
appear and an array of the numbers that have 3s in them
Example:
Input : 35
Output : { count: 10, numbers: [3, 13, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] }

9. Write a function that takes a string and determines if the string is a palindrome. A
palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the
same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar. The function should return “Yes” if
the word is a palindrome and “No” if it isn’t. You are not to use the programming
language’s existing function or method, if any.

10. Write a function that takes a string. The function should calculate the character in the
string with the most occurrences and return that character. If more than one character
has the most occurrence, return those characters as an array.
Example
Input : “afhuusnimr443o0sggg”
Output : “g”
